## Detailed Phase Status

### Phase 0: Foundation Alignment (AGENTS.md Compliance) üü°
**Target Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Actual Duration**: In Progress  
**Completed**: 2025-08-02

**Objectives:**
- [x] Update plan-01.md to include context-first design patterns
- [x] Enhance data models to show context.Context parameters  
- [x] Update testing strategy to explicitly use testify suite
- [x] Add security scanning steps (govulncheck, go mod verify)
- [x] Revise interface designs to follow consumer-driven patterns
- [x] Update verification steps with enhanced security/quality checks
- [x] Update success criteria to include AGENTS.md compliance
- [x] Update plan-01-status.md to reflect Phase 0 addition

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] All function signatures updated to include context.Context as first parameter
- [x] Interfaces defined at point of use (consumer-driven design)
- [x] Error messages provide clear context and actionable guidance
- [x] Test coverage targets increased to 90% using testify patterns
- [x] Security scanning integrated (govulncheck, go mod verify, gitleaks)
- [x] All linting standards per AGENTS.md documented
- [x] Dependency injection patterns specified (no global state)
- [x] Plan documentation updated with enhanced standards

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Enhanced `plans/plan-01.md` with AGENTS.md compliance
- [x] Updated `plans/plan-01-status.md` with Phase 0 tracking
- [x] Context-first design patterns documented
- [x] Consumer-driven interface examples added
- [x] Testify testing strategy specified
- [x] Security scanning integration documented

**Implementation Agent**: Claude Code with go-expert-developer persona

**Notes:**
- Successfully aligned plan with AGENTS.md engineering standards
- Added comprehensive context support throughout architecture
- Enhanced error handling with proper wrapping patterns
- Integrated security scanning and dependency verification
- Updated testing strategy to use testify suite exclusively
- All phases now include AGENTS.md compliance verification

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Configuration ‚è≥
**Target Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Actual Duration**: -  
**Completed**: -

**Objectives:**
- [ ] Fork and initialize project from go-template repository
- [ ] Set up configuration management for .env.config file with context support
- [ ] Create base CLI structure using Cobra with dependency injection
- [ ] Implement configuration validation and loading with context.Context
- [ ] Set up project structure following Go best practices and AGENTS.md standards

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Project builds successfully from go-template base
- [ ] Configuration loads from .env.config file with context support
- [ ] CLI responds to basic commands and respects context cancellation
- [ ] Configuration validation catches invalid inputs with clear error messages
- [ ] Help text displays properly for all commands
- [ ] All operations accept context.Context as first parameter
- [ ] Dependency injection used throughout (no global state)
- [ ] Error handling follows AGENTS.md excellence patterns
- [ ] Tests use testify suite with descriptive names
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in dependencies (govulncheck passes)
- [ ] All linting and formatting passes per AGENTS.md standards
- [ ] This document (plan-01-status.md) updated with implementation status

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `cmd/go-invoice/main.go` - Main entry point with CLI initialization
- [ ] `internal/config/config.go` - Configuration management and validation
- [ ] `internal/config/types.go` - Configuration type definitions
- [ ] `.env.config.example` - Example configuration file
- [ ] `go.mod` - Update module name and dependencies

**Implementation Agent**: Claude Code with go-expert-developer persona

**Notes:**
- Placeholder for implementation notes

*Note: Phases 2-6 follow the same detailed tracking format as Phase 1 above, with their specific objectives, success criteria, and deliverables as defined in the PRD.*

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 0: Foundation Alignment
	- ‚úÖ Update plan documentation with AGENTS.md compliance
	- ‚úÖ Enhance architecture patterns for context-first design
	- ‚úÖ Document security scanning integration

2. Begin Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Configuration
	- Fork go-template repository
	- Set up development environment with enhanced standards
	- Initialize project structure with dependency injection patterns
	- Implement context-first configuration management

## Notes

- All implementation must follow go-template patterns and conventions
- Each phase should be completed with Claude Code using go-expert-developer persona
- Maintain backward compatibility with standard CSV formats
- Focus on printer-friendly output from the start
- This status document should be updated after each phase completion
