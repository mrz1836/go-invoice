- [x] Consumer-driven interface examples added
- [x] Testify testing strategy specified
- [x] Security scanning integration documented

**Implementation Agent**: Claude Code with go-expert-developer persona

**Notes:**

- Added comprehensive context support throughout architecture
- Enhanced error handling with proper wrapping patterns
- Integrated security scanning and dependency verification
- Updated testing strategy to use testify suite exclusively
- All phases now include AGENTS.md compliance verification

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Configuration ✅
**Target Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Actual Duration**: 2 hours  
**Completed**: 2025-08-02

**Objectives:**
- [x] Fork and initialize project from go-template repository
- [x] Set up configuration management for .env.config file with context support
- [x] Create base CLI structure using Cobra with dependency injection
- [x] Implement configuration validation and loading with context.Context
- [x] Set up project structure following Go best practices and AGENTS.md standards

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Project builds successfully from go-template base
- [x] Configuration loads from .env.config file with context support
- [x] CLI responds to basic commands and respects context cancellation
- [x] Configuration validation catches invalid inputs with clear error messages
- [x] Help text displays properly for all commands
- [x] All operations accept context.Context as first parameter
- [x] Dependency injection used throughout (no global state)
- [x] Error handling follows AGENTS.md excellence patterns
- [x] Tests use testify suite with descriptive names
- [x] No security vulnerabilities in dependencies (govulncheck passes)
- [x] All linting and formatting passes per AGENTS.md standards
- [x] This document (plan-01-status.md) updated with implementation status

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `cmd/go-invoice/main.go` - Main entry point with CLI initialization
- [x] `internal/config/config.go` - Configuration management and validation
- [x] `internal/config/types.go` - Configuration type definitions
- [x] `.env.config.example` - Example configuration file
- [x] `go.mod` - Update module name and dependencies

**Implementation Agent**: Claude Code with go-expert-developer persona

**Notes:**
- Successfully implemented complete Phase 1 infrastructure
- Context-first design implemented throughout all services
- Comprehensive configuration management with .env.config support
- CLI framework with Cobra including config validate/show commands
- Dependency injection pattern used throughout (no global state)
- Test coverage: 84-85% using testify suite patterns
- Security scans clean: govulncheck passed, go mod verify passed
- Application builds and runs successfully
- All AGENTS.md compliance requirements met

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete Phase 0: Foundation Alignment
	- ✅ Update plan documentation with AGENTS.md compliance
	- ✅ Enhance architecture patterns for context-first design
	- ✅ Document security scanning integration

2. ✅ Complete Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Configuration
	- ✅ Fork go-template repository
	- ✅ Set up development environment with enhanced standards
	- ✅ Initialize project structure with dependency injection patterns
	- ✅ Implement context-first configuration management

3. Begin Phase 2: Data Models and Storage Layer
