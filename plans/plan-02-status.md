Claude: [Uses import_csv tool] ✅ Imported 14 work items totaling 112 hours

User: "Generate the final invoice as HTML"
Claude: [Uses generate_invoice tool] ✅ Generated invoice-2025-001.html
```

**Claude Code (stdio Transport + Slash Commands):**
```
User: /invoice Create invoice for Acme Corp
Claude: [Executes via stdio] ✅ Created invoice INV-2025-001 for Acme Corp

User: Import hours from timesheet into @invoice:INV-2025-001
Claude: [Uses import_csv with resource mention] ✅ Imported 14 work items

User: /generate Generate @invoice:INV-2025-001  
Claude: [Generates HTML] ✅ Generated invoice-2025-001.html
```

### Success Metrics:

## Notes

- All MCP implementation must follow .github/AGENTS.md patterns and conventions
- Each phase should be completed with Claude Code using go-expert-developer persona
- Maintain complete backward compatibility with existing CLI functionality
- Focus on natural language interaction patterns for optimal Claude Desktop experience
- This status document should be updated after each phase completion
